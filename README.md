# CP-CS-Automation-Scripts
A simple set of scripts written in Python for automation of CP-CS (Cycle Plan-Customer Specific) data processing

Using Pandas and NumPy, the program takes in raw data in either xlsx/b or csv, processes it for merchandise activity forms, and outputs a file/s that's ready for use on Nestle's MARS platform.
The program shortens what is usually a 2-3 days worth of manual work, requiring use of multiple tools (i.e Excel, DAX, and/or Kutools), to just a few clicks. Depending on the volume of data, a script usually parses through data and outputs a file in less than a minute.
